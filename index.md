# About Me
I am a [Research Economist](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/staff/person.asp?id=10783) at the Centre for Econmic Performance (CEP), [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk). My research is currently focused on using data science and econometrics to investigate the emergence of frontier technologies (such as AI, robotics, clean tech, blockchain, and quantum) and their impacts on UK firm performance. Before joining CEP, I conducted research on green techs in the automotive sector (such as the electrification of transportation and the recycling of lithium-ion batteries) as a [Faraday Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk/) Research Fellow. I gained an MSc degree in International Economics (2015) and a PhD degree in Economics (2019) from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk). My broader research interests include multidisciplinary issues that are related to industry, environment, and politics.
