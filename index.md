# About Me
I am an applied economist interested in economic and political issues related to technology, the environment, energy and development. I am currently based at the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP), [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk) as a [Research Officer](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/staff/person.asp?id=10783). Before joining CEP, I was a [Faraday Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk/) Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk), where I gained an MSc degree in International Economics (2015) and a PhD degree in Economics (2019). My active research topics include:
* Innovation, productivity, and sustainable growth.
* The politics of climate-related natural disasters.
* Low-carbon technology, resource security, and circular economy.
* Climate, water resources, energy, and development.
